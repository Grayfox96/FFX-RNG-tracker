# Define macros as key/value pairs
# Keys don't need quotation marks but to avoid errors it is recommended to use them
# Values need quotation marks, 1 for single line and 3 for multiple lines
# Newlines at the start and end of values will be removed
# If a value is not a string it will be ignored
# Values can contain nested macros, define the parent macro first, then the nested one

[General]
# Macros defined in this section will be used for all widgets
# Macros from this section will be evaluated first, unless they are redefined
# in a widget section, in that case only that one will be evaluated
