# Download
Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/Grayfox96/FFX-RNG-tracker/releases) (first .zip file under Assets), unzip it and open `FFX RNG tracker vXX.XX.XX.exe` to use.

# Configs
Game version and category can be changed in the configs file.
It's possible to switch to dark theme, use the default theme and change the font size.

# Notes
Place personalized notes files (*actions_notes.txt*, *drops_notes.txt*, *yojimbo_notes.txt*, *encounters_notes.csv*, *steps_notes.csv*) in one of the *ffx_rng_tracker_notes/* directories to override default ones. Prepend the notes filename with a seed number (e.g. *3556394350_actions_notes.txt*) to open them when the tracker is open with that specific seed.
