# FFX RNG Tracker
* ffx_rng_tracker_ui: main program.
* monster_data_viewer: shows information about monsters retrieved from the game directly.
* encounters_tracker: tracks rng related to encounter formations and preemptives/ambushes.
* seedfinder: used to find a seed given a series of action and the corresponding damage rolls.

Game version and category can be changed in the configs.

Place personalized notes files (*actions_notes.txt*, *drops_notes.txt*, *yojimbo_notes.txt*, *encounters_notes.csv*) in one of the *ffx_rng_tracker_notes/* directories to override default ones. Prepend the notes filename with a seed number (e.g. *3556394350_actions_notes.txt*) to open them when the tracker is open with that specific seed.
