# FFX RNG Tracker
* ffx_rng_tracker_ui: main program.
* monster_data_viewer: shows information about monsters retrieved from the game directly.
* encounters_tracker: tracks rng related to encounter formations and preemptives/ambushes.

To track a PS2 run, open with the *-ps2* command line option.

Place personalized notes files (*actions_notes.txt*, *drops_notes.txt*, *yojimbo_notes.txt*) in the main directory to override default ones.
